# IRIS.IPYNB
CLASSIFICATION OF FLOWER WITH 100% ACCURACY.
Iris Species Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors
This project demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify Iris species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Dataset
The project uses the standard Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features:

SepalLengthCm
SepalWidthCm
PetalLengthCm
PetalWidthCm
Each sample is labeled with one of three species:

Iris-setosa
Iris-versicolor
Iris-virginica
Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run this notebook:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
Project Steps
Load Data: The Iris dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Exploration: Basic data exploration is performed to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset (e.g., head, tail, shape, value counts, info, describe).
Data Preparation: The features (X) and target variable (y) are separated. The features are then normalized using StandardScaler from scikit-learn.
Train-Test Split: The data is split into training and testing sets (80% for training, 20% for testing).
Model Training: A KNN classifier is initialized with n_neighbors=3 and trained using the training data.
Prediction: The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data.
Accuracy Evaluation: The accuracy of the model is evaluated using the accuracy_score metric from scikit-learn.
Code Overview
The notebook contains cells that perform the steps outlined above. Key code snippets include:

Loading the data: pd.read_csv('/content/Iris.csv')
Separating features and target: x=iris.iloc[:,:4], y=iris.iloc[:,-1]
Data normalization: x=preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit_transform(x)
Splitting data: x_train,x_test,y_train,ytest=train_test_split(x,y,test_size=0.2,random_state=1)
Initializing and training the KNN model: knnmodel=KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3), knnmodel.fit(x_train,y_train)
Making predictions: y_predict=knnmodel.predict(x_test)
Evaluating accuracy: accuracy_score(ytest.values,y_predict)
Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 1.0 on the test set, indicating that it perfectly classified all the test samples.

How to Run the Notebook
Upload the Iris.csv file to your Colab environment.
Run each code cell sequentially.
